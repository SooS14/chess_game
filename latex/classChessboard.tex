\subsection{Detailed Description}
the second most important class of the program 

This class contains all the methods that are related to the changes that are realised on the chessboard. It concerns the tasks that are not too specific to one piece.

constructor of the class \char`\"{}\+Chessboard\char`\"{} 

The atribute c\+\_\+board is an 2 dimensions dynamically allocated array of pointees on \char`\"{}\+Piece\char`\"{} classes representing the pieces of a chess game. The empty squares of the board are represented by a pointee on N\+U\+LL. \mbox{\Hypertarget{classChessboard_a53eac522998d8d92cca409493c773f54}\label{classChessboard_a53eac522998d8d92cca409493c773f54}}

destructor of the \char`\"{}\+Chessboard\char`\"{} class 

All the memory that can be deallocated with the pointees contained in c\+\_\+board is deleted. Beware that it is not the case of the pieces that were destroyed during the game since their pointees have been lost.

test if a command is legal 

First the function checks if the characters in move\+\_\+user are contained in \+: \mbox{[}a, h\mbox{]} or \mbox{[}1, 8\mbox{]}. Then it transforms these characters in int and puts them in an array given by the user \+: move\+\_\+grid. Eventually, the function checks if the movement within the chessoard is correct. It also handles the castle $\ast$ movement by filling the array \char`\"{}move\+\_\+user\char`\"{} with a special code \+: the location of the king and the position of the tower.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em move\+\_\+user} & a command of the user \\
\hline
{\em move\+\_\+grid} & an int array created by the user to contain the coordinates $\ast$ of the movement \\
\hline
{\em color} & of the one who is playing\\

Handles the movement of pieces. 

This method creates a save of the game\textquotesingle{}s state and give it to \char`\"{}move\char`\"{}, a virtual method specific to each pieces. It checks if the movement is valid. Then move\+\_\+pieces checks if the king\textquotesingle{}s moving team is in danger. If it is the $\ast$ case the movement is invalid. It also checks if the king of the opposing team is in danger.

This is done by creating a \char`\"{}fake\char`\"{} movement. Indeed, each concerned pieces is given a pointee and the arrival pointee is replaced by the starting piece\textquotesingle{}s pointee. However until everything has been checked no memory is freed.

If the movement is correct then all the memory that needs to be destroyed is freed thanks to the pointees created previously. If not, then the game can be restored thanks to those pointees and an error is sent to the concerned player.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em move\+\_\+grid} & contains the coordinates of the movement \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
a bool to know if the movement have been realised 
\end{DoxyReturn}
